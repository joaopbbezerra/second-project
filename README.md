## Hi, welcome to Matchflix!

  
Here you will be able to see our code and feel free to use it 
We used this technologies:

</div>

  

 - We tried to be as DRY as possible and always tried to use good
   practices while coding so we could make our code cleaner and easier
   to read.
   
 - Our match system uses both favorites (from user and from user’s date)
   to return a match for both of them, so we had some exceptions to be  
   treated, like you shouldn’t be able to add same movie  twice into the
   favorite’s list or match twice with the same movie. As well when one 
   user matched, it had to automatically match the other too. So both   
   the exceptions were treated

   
     
   

 - Another challenge was to give an alert that you had a match, its one 
   of the most important things in our web app and was implemented using
   DOM manipulation inside the HBS cause we couldn’t use it on our route
   and we did it checking if the condition was true in our view

   
     
   

 - Our feeling lucky was the most hard and satisfactory feature that we 
   did. It uses your dates favorites to show you cards one by one (like 
   tinder) and you can choose to like it or not, if you like its a match
   and than it goes to the next one, if you don’t it just pass to the   
   next. We used one route just to pass the information that we needed  
   to our render router and only than it was rendered. Oh our match used
   another DOM Manipulation, but with differences from the first one

   
     
   

 - And we tried as much as possible to do a pleasant and fun experience 
   while choosing movies with someone. Hope you all enjoy it!
